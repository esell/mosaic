# Mosaic

Mo was designed as an entry for the third Go Challenge with the challenge initially being to create a "photo-mosaic generating web application" (this was later changed). As specified in the challenge, Mo has been written 100% in Go (aside from the HTML) using only the Go standard libraries. It currently uses Flickr as it's image source for creating the mosaic tiles.
